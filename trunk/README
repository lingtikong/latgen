latgen : a lattice generation code

Author: Ling-Ti Kong,  konglt_AT_sjtu.edu.cn

This code helps to prepare the atomic position file needed by MD codes,
as well as the map file needed by fix-phonon. Several typical lattices
with different orientations have been coded, yet the user can provide
their unit cell info and uses this code to generate the atomic position
file for their system of interest as well.

When one wants to create the atomic position based on their own lattice
(option 7 in the main menu), one can choose to input the unit cell related
info step by step or by providing an input file.
In the latter case, the format of the input file is similar to that of POSCAR
of VASP, but differs slightly. Here is an example of FCC Cu, with the conventional
orientation:

########################################
3.615
1  0  0
0  1  0
0  0  1
4
0.  0.  0. 
0.5 0.5 0.
0.5 0.  0.5
0.  0.5 0.5 
########################################

The first line is the lattice constant or scaling factor of the lattice,
the 2nd-4th lines are the basis vectors that define the unit cell.
The 5th line lists the number of atoms for each kind of element; here we
just have one kind of element, and 4 atoms in a convention cell of FCC Cu.
From the 6th line, the coordinates are listed. The coordinates are in the
reduced unit, i.e., in unit of alat * A1, alat * A2, alat * A3.
